The structure of the checklist:
1)Number
2)Verify 
3)Result
4)Comment
One point in the checklist is one type of check.
The checklist should reflect the requirements of the program, and nothing unnecessary.
Complex test tasks should be broken down into small points in the checklist.
The checklist can be nested in another checklist if the task is very complex.
